Exercises from "Data Analysis Recipes: Fitting a Model to Data"
## Section 1
### Exercise 1
* This exercise uses a standard linear algebra method to fit a straight line for data points 5 through 20
* This method works fairly well with these data points
* *COMPLETED JUL 2, 2020*
### Exercise 2
* This exercise uses a standard linear algebra method to fit a straight line for all data points
* Once the first four data points are included, the standard linear algebra method begins to fail
* *COMPLETED JUL 2, 2020*
### Exercise 3
* This exercise generalizes the method secribed in this section to fit a second order relationship
* This exercises creates a curve fit of the data
* If all data values are used the curve is negative
* If the poor data values (1-4) are used the curve is positive
* *COMPLETED AS OF JULY 9, 2020*
