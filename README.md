# Preliminary Research Work
## Data Analysis Recipe
Exercises from "Data Analysis Recipes: Fitting a Model to Data"
### Exercise 1
* This exercise uses a standard linear algebra method to fit a straight line for data points 5 through 20
* This method works fairly well with these data points
* *COMPLETED JUL 2, 2020*
### Exercise 2
* This exercise uses a standard linear algebra method to fit a straight line for all data points
* Once the first four data points are included, the standard linear algebra method begins to fail
* *COMPLETED JUL 2, 2020*
### Exercise 3
* This exercise generalizes the method secribed in this section to fit a second order relationship
* This exercises creates a curve fit of the data
* If all data values are used the curve is negative
* If the poor data values (1-4) are used the curve is positive
* *COMPLETED AS OF JULY 9, 2020*

## Scatter Plot Of Orbital Period Vs Eccentricity Colored By Radial Velocity 
### Data
* The data for this plot is the "Gold Sample" from [*Close Binary Companions to APOGEE DR16 Stars: 20,000 Binary-star Systems Across the Color-Magnitude Diagram*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00014)
* The x axis is the Orbital Period of the binary stars in the sample.
  * The Orbital Period has been normalized logarithmically
* The y axis is the eccentricty of the binary star orbits
* The plot is colored by the radial velocity of the binary stars
